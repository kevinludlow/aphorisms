`aphorims.txt` is a working list of aphorisms/quotes/mantras that I enjoy meditating on. I don't provide any attribution, and if anyone is offended by that they can suck my big toe. I suspect most of the original authors would not care were they still alive.

I run `daily_aphorism.sh` as a cron job every morning, which writes a random aphorism to my journal for that day. I also write it on my bathroom mirror so that I am reminded to reflect on it throughout the day.

I welcome and appreciate additions. File an issue or submit a PR.
